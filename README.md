# News Site

Technigo Fall Bootcamp 2023 - Pre-course assignment

Create a classic magazine or newspaper site with a header, a logo and a navbar. The site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop-sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

## The problem

I luckily had no problems setting up the relevant programs to begin and went ok making a simple design. I used both Flexbox and CSS grid to help construct my layout. I asked one question on our slack group, which was helpful, and used google alot as well as the w3schools website to get help on CSS or HTML that I didnt know. I found this project difficult and do not think I have made a very attractive website! I look forward to gaining more knowledge to do better in the course.

Unfortunely, I got Covid a week before this was due :-( I had difficulty making the page responsive and was not able to solve this problem until the 8th August. I am not happy with the overall look of the website, but hoping to learn how to make them look better!. I am also not happy with the header, I tried to do a sub-heading underneath but could not format it correctly and while sick I had to let this one go.

UPDATE - WEEK 5 - A few things fixed for a resubmit, nav bar is now responsive and displays a burger menu with dropdown and hover effect for mobiles. It is great to look back and see how much I have learned in 5 weeks! ðŸ˜€

## The Tech
