# News Site

Technigo Fall Bootcamp 2023 - Pre-course assignment

Create a classic magazine or newspaper site with a header, a logo and a navbar. The site should have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop-sized screens, there should be four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there should just be one card on each row.

## The problem

I luckily had no problems setting up the relevant programs to begin and went ok making a simple design. I used both Flexbox and CSS grid to help construct my layout. I asked one question on our slack group and used google alot as well as the w#schools website to get help on CSS or HTML I didnt know.

Unfortunely, I got Covid a week before this was due :-( I had difficulty making the page responsive and was not able to solve this problem while very sick. The page looks terrible in mobile and is only configured for desktop. Sorry!
